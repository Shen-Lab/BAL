This is the ReadMe file for BAL in protein docking.


src/

prepocess_complex.cpp:  To do prepocessing: minimise the starting structure, calculate the unbound energy, calculate the complex normal modes, calculate the putative interface.
BAL.cpp:                The core program to do BAL, including the Thompson sampling and UQ, P(Mi) calculation.
complex_sample.cpp:     The main sampling program: To sample a new conformation based on the complex normal modes.
hyperparameter.cpp:     The collection of a lot of subroutines: Krging regressor, kernel calculation, entropy calculation, posterior calculation.
scoring_rmsd.py:	Scoring program:  For running the random forest.




Output file:

a.'end'(dir):
	containing the refined structure: receptor.pdb ligand.pdb

b.'scores':   
	The final score of refined structure.

c.'PMI_log':
	The log of area under the posterior.

d.'cond_prob.dat':
	The conditional probability of refined structure: P(RMSD(x^,x*)<4 | x* \in Mi)

e. 'Rmsd_dis':
        The RMSD(x^,x*)  distribution of the posterior
